Description: In a parallel universe, "trick-or-treat" is played by different rules. As technologies became more advanced and the demand for security researchers increased, the government decided to incorporate security concepts into every game and tradition. Instead of candy, kids have the choice of selecting a AES mode and encrypting their plaintext. If they somehow manage to find the FLAG, they get candy. Can you solve this basic problem for the toddlers of this universe?
